# this is useful for running big audits across the entire Mojaloop codebase

##
# What mode should we run the scanner in?
# options:
# - "standalone": will run the tool against all repos listed in the `repos` list (below)
# - "local": will run the tool against the repo defined in `pathToRepo`
# - "docker": will run the tool against the docker images defined in `dockerImages`
mode = 'local'


# How we should process the licenses
# options are:
# - "fossa-api": will export to fossa api (requires FOSSA_API_KEY to be set in .env)
# - "fossa-json": will export from fossa to a folder of json files. This just shows import heirarchies, and doesn't scan licenses
# - "lc-csv": will use npm license-checker, and export to a list of csv files
tool = "lc-csv"
